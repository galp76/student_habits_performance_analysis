# Project Title
# Student Habits Performance Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project exploring the relationship between various student lifestyle habits and their academic performance (exam scores). Using a synthetic dataset sourced from Kaggle, this analysis involves:

*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensuring data quality and preparing it for analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations through statistical summaries and visualizations.
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Applying techniques (potentially including hypothesis testing or regression via Statsmodels) to understand the significance of different factors.
*   **Predictive Modeling (Optional):** Potentially building models (using Scikit-learn) to predict exam scores based on student habits.

The primary goal is to identify key factors associated with higher or lower exam performance and to demonstrate data analysis skills using Python and relevant libraries.

**Technologies Used:**
*   Python
*   Pandas
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn
*   Scikit-learn
*   Statsmodels
*   Jupyter Notebook/Lab
